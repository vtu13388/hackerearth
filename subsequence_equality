'''Chef Tobby is playing a rapid fire with Bhuvan. He gives Bhuvan a string S and each time, Bhuvan has to guess whether there exists 2 equal subsequences in the string or not.

Bhuvan got a perfect score in the game with Chef Tobby. However, Chef Tobby has now asked Bhuvan to write a program that will do this automatically given a string S.
Bhuvan is an intelligent man but he does not know how to write a code.
Can you help him?

Find two different subsequences such that they are equal in their value, more formally, find two sequences of indices (a1, a2, ..., ak-1, ak) and (b1, b2, ..., bk-1, bk) such that:

1≤ ai, bi ≤ |S|
ai < ai+1 for all valid i
bi < bi+1 for all valid i
Sai = Sbi for all valid i
there exist at least one i such that ai is not equal to bi
sample input:
4
likecs
venivedivici
bhuvan
codechef

Sample Output:
no
yes
no
yes

Explanation:
In test case 2, one of the possible equal subsequence is "vi" and "vi". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 7}, assuming 0-based indexing).

In test case 4, one of the possible equal subsequence is "ce" and "ce". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 6}, assuming 0-based indexing).'''

#code:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a=list(input())
    c=0
    for i in a:
        if(a.count(i)>1):
            c+=1
    if(c>=1):
        print("yes")
    else:
        print('no')
