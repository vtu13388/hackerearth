'''given n numbers and find the sum of all the possible arrangements of the given numbers
if the given numbers are same then also the the arrangement is considered as different 
if the given numbers are 1,1 then two arrangements are possible they are 11 and 11 so the ans will be 22
sample input:
1           #testcase
2           #no of elements
1 2
sample output:
33
explanation:
possible combinations are 12 and 21 so sum of those numbers is 33'''
