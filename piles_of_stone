'''there are three piles of stones.the first pile contains a stones ,second pile contains b stones,third pile contains c stones.you must choose one of the pile and split the stones 
from it and add them to remaining two piles.if choosen piles contains s stones,you should choose an integer k
move k stones from choosen pile onto one of the remaining piles and s-k stones to remaining pile.determine if it is 
possible for the two remaining piles to contain x stones and y stones after performing the action.

input format:
first line consist of no of test cases
next line consist of a,b,c,x,y

input:
1
1 2 3 2 4

output:
YES

explanation:
a=1,b=2,c=3  x=2,y=4
choose the pile with max stones from a,b,c then split the stones and add them to the remaining piles 
and check whether the x and y are arriving or not if yes print YES else NO
CONDITIONS:a+(maxi-i)==x and b+(maxi-(i-1))==y 
here i-1 because we have to check it with one num less than the num we have checked it for a'''


for _ in range(int(input())):
    a,b,c,x,y=map(int,input().split())
    maxi=max(a,b,c)
    f=0
    for i in range(1,maxi+1):
        if(a+(maxi-i)==x and b+(maxi-(i-1))==y):
            f=1
            break
        else:
            f=0
    if(f==1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
