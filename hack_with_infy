'''given the n and n items a1,a2.....an where ai denotes the type of item ,the task is to select the max number of items by satisfying the conditions given
conditions:
1.no adjacent items should be taken
2.should select only one item type

input:
1
8
12211211

output:
1
explanation:
if he selects 1 means he can take the items at positions a1,a4,a7 so total 3
if he selects 2 he can take the items at positions a2,a6 so total 2
so 3>2 so,1 will be the answer
note:if both 1 and 2 have same total then the ans should be 1'''
