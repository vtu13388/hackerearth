'''akanksha is lazy and she wants to solve her assignment
she has a t numbers and her assignment is to tell no of bits when converted to its binary equivalent to be altered to convert the number to its additive identity
sample input:
1
18
sample output:
2
explantion:
the binary value of 18 will have two 1's so the ans is 2 why because we need make it as zero
here additive identity means zero'0'.'''
