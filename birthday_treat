'''Its Chef's Birthday and his friends are demanding him for treat. So he went to the shop to buy N gift packets (one for each friend). 
Each gift packet bought from shop contains some number of chocolates in it.
Chef believes in equality i.e. all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates in it. 
So Chef thought to rearrange the chocolates, one by one, such that all gift packets should contain equal number of chocolates afterwards.
But since its Chef's Birthday he wants to do this in minimum number of chocolates moved. Help Chef to do this task and you might also get treat from Chef :p

Now in next move he moves one chocolate from last gift packet to 2nd gift packet. 
Final distribution looks like 4 4 4 4 which took place in 2 moves.'''
