'''Given two integers L and B denoting the length and breadth of a rectangle respectively. 
The task is to calculate the sum of the area of all possible squares that comes into the rectangle.

Examples:

Input: L = 4, B = 3
Output: 54

Input:  L = 2, B = 5
Output: 26
explanation:
Now, the number of squares of side 1 will be 12 as there will be two cases one as squares of 1-unit sides along the horizontal(3) and 
second case as squares of 1-unit sides along the vertical(4). That gives us 3*4 = 12 squares.

When the side is 2 units, one case will be as squares of side of 2 units along only one place horizontally and second case as two places vertically. 
So the number of squares = 6

So we can deduce that,
Number of squares of size 1*1 will be L*B

Number of squares of size 2*2 will be (L-1)(B-1)

Therefore, the number of squares with size K will be:

Number of square of size "K = (L-K+1)*(B-K+1)"

Therefore, area of total number of squares of size K will be:

Area of total number of square of size "K = (L-K+1)*(B-K+1)*K*K"

#code:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l,b=map(int,input().split())
    size=1
    max_size=min(l,b)
    totalarea=0
    for i in range(1,max_size+1):
        squares=((l-size+1)*(b-size+1))
        area=squares*size*size
        totalarea+=area
        size+=1
    print(totalarea)
